        <p>I have spent 6 months of 2020 combining my full-time job with a <span id="green-color-bold">Full-stack Web Developer Bootcamp</span> at Le Wagon in Barcelona. It was the most challenging 6 months of my life, but it was worth every second!

        <p>Before my journey into code ðŸš€, I studied tourism, starting in Brazil, and finishing it in Spain. This changed my view of the world and allowed me to learn about so many different countries and cultures.
