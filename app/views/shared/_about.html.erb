  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I have spent 6 months of 2020 combining my full-time job with a Full-stack Web Developer Bootcamp at Le Wagon in Barcelona. It was the most challenging 6 months of my life, but it was worth every second!
    During this period, I worked in a Full Stack Web Developer team creating two web apps using Ruby on Rails, from user stories through the production environment to demo day.
  </p>
  <p>Before my journey into code, I studied tourism, starting in Brazil, and finishing it in Spain. This changed my view of the world and allowed me to learn about so many different countries and cultures.
  </p>
  <p>Since I was a child, hospitality and technology were my passion. I was interested in the latest video game technologies, fascinated by the hotel as a system and how it all works. In 2016 I decided to do a master's in Hotel Management because I wanted to learn how online distribution strategies work and understand the challenges a hotelier encounters every day. It has helped me know my client's business and objectives and prepare them to face the new online distribution challenges.
